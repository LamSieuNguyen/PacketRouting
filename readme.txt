------
Mostly runs and compiles.

When trying to compile the parallelDijkstra, has a problem with the main on my computer. The code seems fine as it has worked before and was provided by the Proffessor as a template.

The same can be found during the bellmanFord.

Fixed most errors regarding the initialize, update distance. 
BellmanFord in shortestPath may have issues.
